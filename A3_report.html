			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<b>TODO: label thousands</b>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/sketch1.png" width='100%' alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This visualization shows the number of people in different age groups by year. Each long rectangle corresponds to a year, and the sub-rectangles within each long rectangle correspond to the different age groups (children and young adults, working age, and elderly people). The opacity of the sub-rectangles corresponds to the number of people in each age group.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to let the width of the rectangles correspond to the years in the age group (such that, i.e., larger age groups have longer sub-rectangles). The rationale behind this design choice was that the size of the rectangles would then roughly correspond to the number of years a person spends in the respective age categories. For the last age group, which goes from 65 to 90+ and thus has no maximum age, I decided to let the width roughly correspond to the distance between 65+ and 110, since 110 seemed a reasonable upper bound for age in that category. (For creating a final visualization, I would further research what the actual maximum age someone has lived to is.)</li>
				<li>I decided to divide the ages into these larger categories, as opposed to creating sub-rectangles for each 5-year bucket, because I wanted this visualization to give a macro view of the population at different stages of life. I used three categories that appear to be standard in population analysis.</li>
				<li>I decided to use the absolute number of people to determine the opacity of the sub-rectangles, as opposed to the percentage of the population in each age group, because I wanted this visualization to allow for a comparison of the number of people across years.</li>
				<li>What I wanted this visualization to allow for was a comparison of the total number of people in each age group across years. However, I think some sort of bar plot (or other visualization where <i>size</i> corresponds to number) would have been more effective, as I used <i>opacity</i> here, which is not as effective for encoding raw number. For similar reasons, I think my decision to use size of rectangles to correspond to the number of years in the age group confuses the message of the visualization, and I would change this in a future iteration.</li>
				
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/sketch2.png" width='100%' alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This visualization shows the number of people in different age groups, by year and sex. The x-axis shows the age categories in 5-year buckets, and the y-axis shows the number of people. The number of males is shown above the x-axis, and the number of females is shown below the x-axis. Color indicates sex, and fill pattern indicates year. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted this visualization to allow for comparison of how population sizes compared across years and across age groups. I chose to plot both years on the same plot, as opposed to creating a subplot for each year, because I noticed that 2000 had strictly more people in every age group/sex category than 1900, and plotting them on the same plot would highlight this difference. If, on the other hand, there were some age groups in which 1900 had more people than 2000, the visualization might be a bit hard to interpret, because the shaded areas for the different years would overlap and intersect. However, in the visualization's current form, it is clear that 2000 has strictly more people, since the boundary for the 2000 area is always on the outside of the boundary for 1900.</li>
				<li>I chose the colors for males/females to be blue/pink, respectively, because these colors are commonly associated with these sexes and thus are not only easily distinguisable, but also intuitive to interpret, with minimal cognitive processing required.</li>
				<li>I chose to shade the areas under the lines, as opposed to simply plotting the lines, for several reasons: First, the distance from the y-value at a given point to the x-axis (y-value=0) is meaningful, and shading the area under the line makes this distance visually clear. Second, shading the areas under the lines helps highlight that it is <i>magnitude</i> rather than <i>direction</i> that is important in this visualization: For the values corresponding to the female line, without the shading, it might be easy to interpret the y-values as negative, since they are below the x-axis. The shading makes the <i>location</i> of the y-values relative to the x-axis less salient, and the <i>magnitude</i> of the values (i.e. distance to the x-axis) more salient.</li>
				<li>I think there is even more I can do to make the female values less associated with negativity: First, rotating the plot 90 degrees so that the male and female data are plotted symmetrically about the y-axis (vs the x-axis) might help. Second, I might plot the female data in the area of the plot that is more commonly associated with positive values (i.e. above the x-axis or to the right of the y-axis) to counterbalance the fact that the pink color is already more commonly associated with negative values.</li>
				<li>In a future version, I might also label the different years directly on the plot, as opposed to just in the legend, to make it easier to interpret the plot.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					This plot shows the proportion of people in different age groups that are male, by year. The x-axis shows the age categories in 5-year buckets, and the y-axis shows the proportion of people in that 5-year bucket who are male. The two lines correspond to the two years, 1900 and 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose to sketch <i>proportions</i> in this visualization because I wanted this visualiation to show the relative number of males and females in different age categories by year, rather than to enable comparisons in absolute population size across years. I think this visualization overall achieves this goal, as it makes it easy to see a few distinct trends: 2000 tended to have more younger men than women but more older women than men; in 1900, the trend was the opposite, with more older men than women.</li>
				<li>I chose to annotate a horizontal reference line corresponding to 50% to make it easy to see the threshold at which the number of males is equal to the number of females.</li>	
				<li>I chose to highlight the reference line in the lightest color so that it would be less salient than the lines for 1900 and 2000 and thus would appear less salient than the lines for the actual data.</li>
				<li>I chose to plot the y-values as lines rather than disconnected points because I wanted to highlight how the proportion of males changed across age groups. However, I think the lines could be improved in the following ways: First, I think the visualization could shade the area over or under the reference 50% line to make salient when there are more men than women in a given age group. Second, I think lines might not be the best way to represent the data, since the lines suggest that the data is changing over time, when in fact the data is static (i.e. for a fixed year). I would improve this visualization by using bars at each x-value, perhaps with colors corresponding to whether they are above or below the 50% line.</li>
				<li>I also think colors could be used more intentionally in this visualization. In a future iteration, I would choose to use non-gray colors for the lines corresponding to years, to make these lines both more salient and easier to distinguish (from each other and from the background/reference line).</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The guiding question I wanted to answer was "How did the demographic make-up of the U.S. change from 1900 to 2000?" I think sketches 2 and 3 are stronger visualizations than sketch 1 for answering this question. Sketch 1 was intended to communicate comparison of the number of people in different age groups across 1900 and 2000. Sketch 2 is more effective at communicating this comparison because it uses size as an encoding for number, as opposed to opacity: It is easier to see that 2000 had overall more people than in 1900. It <i>also</i> highlights other trends in the same visualization, such as more fine-grained comparisons across age groups and comparisons of male vs. female populations. Thus, sketch 2 communicates strictly more information than sketch 1, and communicates it more effectively. Sketch 3 communicates a different type of information than the first two sketches, specifically focusing on the comparison of males and females across age groups and years. I think because sketch 3 plots transformed data (i.e. proportions of age groups that are male, vs raw numbers), it makes it easier to see the relative numbers of males and females; while this data is also plotted in sketch 2, it is harder to draw comparisons across the male and female populations in sketch 2. Thus, I think sketch 2 and 3 are both stronger than sketch 1, but for different reasons. Which visualization is "best" depends on the specific sub-question the visualization is intended to answer. Sketch 2 might be best for answering questions about how the overall population size in different age groups changed from 1900 to 2000, while sketch 3 might be best for answering questions about how the breakdown of males and females in each age group changed from 1900 to 2000. I think one way sketch 2 could be changed such that this second question could be more easily answered is by adding labels for each point so that a viewer could compare the number of males vs females for a given age category if they wanted to: These labels could either show the absolute number of males/females in each age category, or the proportion of each.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/final_design_final.png" width="100%" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This plot shows the number of people in different age groups, by year and sex. The y-axis shows the age categories in 5-year buckets, and the x-axis shows the number of people. Colors indicate sex and year. For a given age group and year, we annotate the bar (male or female) that contains more than 50% of the population in that age group/year.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
		I chose to create a visualization based on sketch 2 while incorporating insights from sketch 3 so that the visualization would facilitate both comparisons of the <i>absolute</i> number of people in different age groups across years and some comparisons of the <i>relative</i> numbers of males vs. females in different age groups across years. I brought in insights from sketch 3 with data transformation and annotations: I annotated the bars that contain more than 50% of the population in that age group/year so that a viewer could see at a glance which age groups/years had more males and which had more females. I think that these annotations are overall helpful for determining in which age groups and years there were more males than females (and vice versa): For instance, it stands out that in 2000, there were more males than females in younger age groups and more females than males in older age groups. However, I do think that seeing this trend requires slightly more cognitive effort than for sketch 3. Given that this visualization <i>also</i> communicates a lot more information--such as how the overall population size in different age groups changed from 1900 to 2000--I think that this tradeoff is worth it and this visualization is overall stronger than sketch 3. However, for specific uses of the visualization--such as if the intention were to only facilitate easy comparison of relative number of males vs females--then sketch 3 might be a better choice. 
		<br><br>
		In addition to bringing in elements of what sketch 3 communicated, I also made several other design decisions that I think improved the visualization. First, I chose to make the visualization symmetric about the y-axis (as opposed to the x-axis) so that it would appear less that some of the values were negative. I also chose to show the female bars on the right side of the plot, as opposed to the left, to counteract the negative association of the color pink.
		Second, I decided to use bars instead of shaded areas under lines to represent the data because I noticed that lines could imply that the data was changing over time, when in fact the data is static.
		Third, I chose to use different colors instead of different hatches to indicate year because I think color more clearly highlights the difference between years. I also chose to use a lighter color for 1900 because it is before 2000, and light vs. dark might invoke the idea of "before" vs. "after." I also matched the edge colors/annotation colors for consistency.

		Overall, I found the sketch phase of the design process to be very helpful. The sketches helped me to think through the different types of information I wanted to communicate and to consider how different visual encodings could be used to communicate this information. For instance, my first sketch highlighted limitations of using opacity to encode number. The sketch phase also helped me uncover trends in the data that I might not have noticed otherwise and prompted me to think about how I could weave together these different trends into a single visualization (such as by using annotations). I started the assignment thinking there would be limited takeaways from a small dataset with only a few variables, but the sketch phase helped me to see that there were actually many different types of information I could communicate with the data.
